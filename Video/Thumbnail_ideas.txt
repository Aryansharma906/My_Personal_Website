Thumbnail ideas

Option A (clean):
- Big text: "Refactor & Deploy React Site"
- Subtext: "Centralize socials + GitHub Pages"
- Visual: screenshot of VS Code on the left and terminal on the right, with a red arrow pointing to code.

Option B (personal):
- Big text: "Fix LinkedIn Links"
- Subtext: "Centralize socials in 10 minutes"
- Visual: a portrait crop (if you want), plus a GitHub logo and a "Deploy" badge.

Tips:
- Use bold, high-contrast colors (white/yellow on dark background).
- Keep the face large if it's a talking-head video.
- Add a small badge: "Vite + React" in a corner.
