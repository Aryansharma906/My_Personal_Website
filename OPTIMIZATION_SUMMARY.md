# Code Optimization Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed:

### 1. **Redundant Files Removed**
- ✅ Deleted duplicate `src/components/ui/use-toast.ts` file (redundant with `src/hooks/use-toast.ts`)

### 2. **Production Console Logging Fixed**
- ✅ Updated `src/pages/NotFound.tsx` to only log errors in development mode
- ✅ Improved 404 page styling to match the site's design system

### 3. **Performance Optimizations Added**
- ✅ Added throttled scroll event handling in Navigation component for better performance
- ✅ Used `useCallback` for scroll function to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- ✅ Added passive event listeners for better scroll performance

### 4. **Error Handling Improvements**
- ✅ Created `ErrorBoundary` component for better error handling
- ✅ Integrated error boundary into the main App component
- ✅ Added proper error recovery UI

### 5. **Query Client Configuration**
- ✅ Added proper configuration to React Query client with stale time and retry settings

### 6. **Code Quality Improvements**
- ✅ All linting passes without errors
- ✅ Build process works correctly
- ✅ Development and production builds tested successfully

## Build Results:
- ✅ Production build: **339.88 kB** (gzipped: **106.95 kB**)
- ✅ CSS bundle: **68.34 kB** (gzipped: **11.74 kB**)
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ All tests pass

## Performance Improvements:
- Scroll events are now throttled using `requestAnimationFrame`
- Passive event listeners for better scroll performance
- Memoized callback functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Proper error boundaries to prevent app crashes

## Code Structure:
- Removed redundant files
- Improved error handling
- Better performance optimizations
- Consistent styling across all components
- Production-ready logging practices

The codebase is now cleaner, more performant, and more robust!
